## Sample Rate

![Sampling](assets/Signal_Sampling.svg)

44.1khz (CD Quality) and 48khz (DVD Quality) are the common standards

@note - Nyquistâ€“Shannon sampling theorem: sample rate must be twice the signal bandwidth to avoid aliasing
- mismatching sample rates can lead to artifacting or playback at the wrong speed in some software
