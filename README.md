# Web Audio API Presentation

This is the presentation I gave at [Silicon Swamp](https://www.siliconswamp.org/) on 26 September 2024, which you may [watch a recording of here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncok8HPDerY).

This presentation covers:
- Web Audio API
- Web Midi API
- an overview of how audio works on a computer
- some strategies on how to manage the complexity of larger audio projects
- interactive demos of Web Audio Nodes

I pulled many code examples from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/), and some pictures from several Wikipedia articles.

You might be wondering about the turtle picture at the beginning. Early on, we adopted a practice of including a "Swamp Animal", so I included a picture of an [Alligator Snapping Turtle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator_snapping_turtle) that I took at the Ruth Patrick Science Center at USCA in Aiken, SC.

This presentation also includes some demos of these APIs, and a preview of another project I'm working on to implement a modular wrapper around the Web Audio API in order to allow other projects to be used together.

If you have questions about anything in the project, or in general want to talk about Audio, Music, or Programming topics, feel free to reach out to the email on my Github profile.

This presentation was made using [reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/).
